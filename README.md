# Wheel-Menu
Wheel Menu is a mechanism to 'do' something by selecting an option from the menu which looks like a wheel. There are many triple-A games who implemented this feature like GTA V, RDR 2, Mafia III, Watch Dogs: Legion, Far Cry 6, etc. This modification will allows you to use the wheel menu mechanics in Bully: Scholarship Edition (PC).
