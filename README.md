# Wheel-Menu
Wheel Menu is a mechanism to 'do' something by selecting an option from the menu which looks like a wheel. There are many triple-A games who implemented this feature like GTA V, RDR 2, Mafia III, Watch Dogs: Legion, Far Cry 6, etc. This modification will allows you to use the wheel menu mechanics in Bully: Scholarship Edition (PC).

Requirement:
- Derpy's Script Loader (alpha 3+).

Installation:
- Copy (or Cut) Wheel Menu folder.
- Paste it into '../Bully - Scholarship Edition/_derpy_script_loader/scripts/' folder.

Control:
KEYBOARD & MOUSE | XBOX CONTROLLER | ASSIGNMENT
:--- | :--- | :---
Q	| L3 (Fixed) | show or hide the wheel menu
Mouse Movement | Right Analog Movement | select category
Mouse Wheel Down | LB | go to previous item
Mouse Wheel Up | RB | go to next item
Left Arrow | Left D Pad | go to previous tab
Right Arrow | Right D Pad | go to next tab

nb: Those keys are configurable (see config.ini).
