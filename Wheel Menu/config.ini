[GAME]
# There is no known safe method to make everything run in slow motion like GTA V.
# Therefore, the game motion and sound will stop if the wheel menu is active.
# 
# If you prefer to switch something in real time, you can enable the game_motion.
# Enabling game_motion will automatically enable the game_sound too.
# 
# If game_sound is enabled, you can hear sound effects while scrolling around.

# These following settings will alter the screen colors to be more darker by default.
